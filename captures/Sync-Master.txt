Interesting packets in Sync-Master.pcapng
=========================================

This capture was running while the DJM-2000 nexus mixer was used to
send commands to the players (with device numbers 2 and 3) to turn
Sync on and off, and then to assign the Tempo Master role to player 2,
then 3, then 2 again, and finally to the mixer itself.

Only traffic to and from player 2 is seen, since that connection was
run through spanned switch ports.

Packet  Type  Path   Meaning
------  ----  -----  -------
15320   0x2a  M>P2   Turn on Sync  (last byte 0x10)
19853   0x2a  M>P2   Turn off Sync (last byte 0x20)
26459   0x2a  M>P2   Turn on Sync

32213   0x2a  M>P2   Become Master (last byte 0x01)
32235   0x26  P2>P3  Announce new Master (with P2's # as last byte)
32249   0x27  P3>P2  Ack new Master (last byte 0x01)

40076   0x26  P3>P2  Announce new Master (with P3's # as last byte)
40090   0x27  P2>P3  Ack new Master

46245   0x2a  M>P2   Become new Master
46266   0x26  P2>P3  Announce new Master
46280   0x27  P3>P2  Ack new Master

51026   0x26  M>P2   Announce new Master (with M's # as last byte)
51060   0x27  P2>M   Ack new master

Note that the new master announcement seems to be sent only from the
device taking over the Master role to the current Master, and this
is then acked. The mixer only sends a Become Master command when it
is not taking over the Master role itself; to do that it just sends
a normal Announce new Master message.
